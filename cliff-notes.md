**What I usually forget or an unfamiliar with**

- RDS authentication with IAM is possible
  - works with MySQL and Postgres
  - Uses auth token instead of passwords
    - RDS generates on request
    - Generated using AWS Signature v4
    - 15 minutes lifetime.
  - No need to store user credentials. Managed by IAM
  - Can still use database auth.
  - Network traffic is encrypted using SSL
  - Can use profile credentials specific to EC2 instance to access database instead of passwords.
- AWS Budgets can set custom budget that alerts when cost, usage, or forecasted usage exceeds the budget.
  - Monthly, quarterly, or yearly
  - Alerts can be sent via email or SNS topic
  - Set a custom reservation utlitization target. Receive alerts when underutilized.
  - Create and track from Budgets dashboard or Budgets API
- Cost explorer helps visualize and manage AWS costs and usages over time.
  - Reports / data last up to the last 13 months.
  - Forecast next three months
  - Recommend RI purchases.
- Convert private key (.pem) to .ppk to ssh instance using PuTTY
- Usual AMI usernames
  - Amazon Linux - ec2-user
  - RHEL - ec2-user / root
  - Ubuntu - ubuntu / root
  - Cenots - centos
  - Debian - admin / root
  - Fedora - ec2-user
  - SUSE - ec2-user / root
- S3 Client side encryption
  - Encrypt data before sending to S3
  - Can either use:
    - AWS KMS-managed customer master key
      - Provide AWS KMS customer master key ID (CMK ID) to AWS.
    - Client-side master key.
      - Client-side master keys and unencrypted data are never sent to AWS.
    - Cannot decrypt data when encryption keys are lost.
  - When uploading:
    - S3 encryption client generates one-time-use symmetric key aka data encryption key or data key. 
      - Uses data key to encrypt single S3 object, ie data key is per object.
    - Client encrypts the data key using the provided master key.
    - Client uploads the encrypted data key and its material description as part of the object metadata.
       - Client uses the material description to know which client-side master key to use for decryption.
    - Client uploads encrypted data to S3
    - Client saves encrypted data key as object metadata (x-amz-meta-x-amz-key) in S3.
