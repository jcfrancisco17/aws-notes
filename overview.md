# Overview of Amazon Web Services (January 2020)

## Six Advantages of Cloud Computing

 - Trade capital expense for variable expense
 - Benefit from massives economies of scale
 - Stop guessing capacity
 - Increase speed and agility
 - Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
 - Go global in minutes

 ## Types of Cloud Computing

 - Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
   - Basic buiding blocks
     - networking features 
     - computers (virtual or dedicated hardware)
     - data storage space
    - Provides highest level of flexibility and control over IT resources.
 - Platform as a Service (Paas)
   - Removes the need to manage the underlying infrastructure (hardware and OS)
   - Focus on deployment and management of applications
   - No need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, etc.
 - Software as a Service (SaaS)
   - A complete product that is run and managed by the service provider.
   - An end-user application.
   - No need to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed.
 
## Cloud Computing Deployment Models

- Cloud
  - Fully deployed in the cloud and all parts of the application run in the cloud.
  - Either created in the cloud or migrated to the cloud.
 - Hybrid
   - Cloud and existing on-premises infrastructure
 - On-premises
   - Same as legacy IT infrastructure but uses virtualization and resource management tools
   - Sought because of its ability to provide dedicated resources.

## Global Infrastructure

 - AWS Cloud Infrastructure
   - Built around AWS Regions and Availabililty Zones (AZ)
   - Currently over 60 AZs over 20 Regions
 - AWS Region
   - A physical location in the world
   - Designed to be completely isolated from other regions.
   - A Region has multiple AZs.
 - Availability Zone
   - Consists of one or more discrete data centers
   - Has redundant power, networking, and connectivity, housed in separate facilities.
   - AZs in a Region are connected through low-latency links.
   - Designed as an independent failure zone.
   - Redundantly connected to multiple tier-1 transit providers

## Security and Compliance

### Security

 - Cloud security at AWS is the higheset priority.
 - Much like on-premise security but without the cost of maintaining facilities and hardware.
 - Uses softwre-based security tools to monitor and protect the flow of information in and out of cloud resources.
 - AWS Cloud enables a shared responsibility model.
   - AWS manages security of the cloud
   - You are responsible for security in the cloud.

#### Benefits of AWS Security

 - Keep your data safe
   - All data is stored in highly secure AWS data centers.
 - Meet compliance requirements
   - Segments of your compliance have already been completed.
 - Save money
   - Maintain highest standard of security without managing your own facility.
 - Scale quickly
   - Security scale with AWS Cloud usage.
